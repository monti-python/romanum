# Introduction
Romanum is a ready-to-run REST API to convert a range of numbers to Roman numerals.

# Requirements
- Ensure the client can submit a range of numbers (e.g., 10-50).
- Handle numbers within the range of 1 to 3999; any numbers outside this range should return an error message.
- The server must accurately convert all numbers in the specified range to Roman numerals.
- Collect and return all results in ascending order.
- Provide the OpenAPI specification.
- Wrap the service into a Docker container.
- Create an integration test suite to automate the evaluation of the functionality.

# Improvements
- Provide thoughts on what improvements could be made if you had more time. Also, provide information about what is missing to have this API production ready.
